"""Per-game competitive AI result recording and per-model aggregation.

Each finished game appends one JSON line to `settings.stats_path`. Aggregation
groups those records by the model assigned to each LLM seat, so the `/stats` page
can compare model performance. Recording is best-effort: any failure is logged
and swallowed so it can never interrupt a game.
